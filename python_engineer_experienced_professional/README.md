Running the program requires the following steps:

**1** Run main.py file; 
*a change the 'file_index'; if you do so, the program opens the corresponding data file in the*
*data folder and writes as well, to the corresponding schema file in the schema folder*
*i.e if file_index = 1 then data_1.json is opened and required components written to schema_1.json*

**2** Run test.py file; 
*same as above; however, for tests.
